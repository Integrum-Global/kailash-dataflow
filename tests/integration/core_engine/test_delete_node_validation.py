"""
Integration tests for DeleteNode validation (Bug #2: Dangerous default id=1).

These tests verify that DeleteNode properly validates record IDs and never silently
defaults to id=1 when no ID is provided. This is a CRITICAL security issue that could
result in unintended data deletion.

Bug Location: apps/kailash-dataflow/src/dataflow/core/nodes.py:1422-1423

Test Strategy (TDD RED Phase):
- These tests should FAIL initially due to the dangerous default behavior
- After fixing the bug, all tests should pass
- Uses real PostgreSQL database (NO MOCKING) via IntegrationTestSuite
